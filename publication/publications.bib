  abstract     = {More and more proteomics datasets are becoming available in public repositories. The knowledge embedded in these datasets can be used to improve peptide identification workflows. Spectral library searching provides a straightforward method to boost identification rates using previously identified spectra. Alternatively, machine learning methods can learn from these spectra to accurately predict the behavior of peptides in a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system.

At the basis of both approaches are spectral libraries: Unified collections of previously identified spectra. Organizations and projects such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Global Proteome Machine, PeptideAtlas, PRIDE Archive and MassIVE have all compiled spectral libraries for a multitude of species and experimental setups. A large obstacle, however, is that each organization provides libraries in a different file format. At the software level the problem propagates (if not expands), as different software tools require different file formats.

The solution is a standardized spectral library format that is sufficiently flexible to meet all users' demands, but that is also standardized enough to be usable across environments and software packages. This balance is achieved by setting up a standardized framework and a controlled vocabulary with metadata terms, and allow the format to be represented in different forms, such as plain text, JSON and HDF.

So far, the required (and optional) meta data has been compiled and added to the PSI-MS ontology, and versions of the text and JSON representations have been drafted. The tabular and HDF representations of the format are in development, as well as converters and validators in various programming languages.},

  abstract     = {MS²PIP is a data-driven tool that accurately predicts peak intensities for a given peptide's fragmentation mass spectrum. Since the release of the (MSPIP)-P-2 web server in 2015, we have brought significant updates to both the tool and the web server. In addition to the original models for CID and HCD fragmentation, we have added specialized models for the TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer, for TMT-labeled peptides, for iTRAQ-labeled peptides, and for iTRAQ-labeled phosphopeptides. Because the fragmentation pattern is heavily altered in each of these cases, these additional models greatly improve the prediction accuracy for their corresponding data types. We have also substantially reduced the computational resources required to run (MSPIP)-P-2, and have completely rebuilt the web server, which now allows predictions of up to 100 000 peptide sequences in a single request. The MS(2)PIPweb server is freely available at https://iomics.ugent.be/ms2pip/.},
