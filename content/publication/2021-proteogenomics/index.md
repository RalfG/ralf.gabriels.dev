abstract: "Proteogenomics approaches often struggle with the distinction between true and false peptide-to-spectrum matches as the database size enlarges. However, features extracted from tandem mass spectrometry intensity predictors can enhance the peptide identification rate and can provide extra confidence for peptide-to-spectrum matching in a proteogenomics context. To that end, features from the spectral intensity pattern predictors MS2PIP and Prosit were combined with the canonical scores from MaxQuant in the Percolator postprocessing tool for protein sequence databases constructed out of ribosome profiling and nanopore RNA-Seq analyses. The presented results provide evidence that this approach enhances both the identification rate as well as the validation stringency in a proteogenomic setting."
