In 2017, after completing a bioinformatics thesis project in the [CompOmics](https://compomics.com/) group, I obtained my MSc degree in Biomedical Sciences at Ghent University. Since January 2018, I am continuing the work of my master thesis as an [FWO-SB PhD fellow](https://www.fwo.be/en/) in CompOmics, under the supervision of prof. Sven Degroeve and prof. Lennart Martens.

My research mainly involves applying Machine Learning to proteomics data, with a focus on the identification of post-translationally modified peptides. I am also a member of the [European Bioinformatics Community](https://eubic-ms.org/) organizational committee and help developing community standards in computational mass spectrometry at [HUPO-PSI](http://www.psidev.info/).
