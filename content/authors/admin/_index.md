I obtained my MSc degree in Biomedical Sciences at Ghent University in 2017 after completing a bioinformatics thesis project in the CompOmics group. In January 2018, I continued the work of my master thesis as an [FWO-SB PhD fellow](https://www.fwo.be/en/) under the supervision of prof. Sven Degroeve and prof. Lennart Martens. In May 2022, I graduated as Doctor in Life Sciences and was granted a [Junior Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.fwo.be/en/) by FWO, starting in October 2022.

My research involves investigating novel applications of machine learning in proteomics, with a focus on peptide identification. I am a member of the [European Bioinformatics Community for Mass Spectrometry](https://eubic-ms.org/) organizational committee and I contribute to the development of community standards in computational mass spectrometry at [HUPO-PSI](http://www.psidev.info/).
